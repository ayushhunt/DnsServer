# Basic DNS Server in JavaScript

This project implements a basic DNS server using JavaScript. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how DNS servers operate behind the scenes, including the process of mapping domain names to IP addresses.

## Features

- A simple DNS server that resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- Provides insights into how DNS query and response flows work.
- Illustrates the mapping process from domain names to corresponding IP addresses.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with DNS server functionality.
- Explored the internal workings of DNS queries and responses.
- Learned how domain-to-IP mapping is handled within a DNS server.

## Usage

To run the DNS server:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd repo-name

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
npm install

# Start the DNS server
node server.js
